              reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
              its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
              charge you for the app or its services without making it very
              clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.

              The Ghost Zone app stores and processes personal data that
              you have provided to us, in order to provide my
              Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
              access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
              not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
              removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
              official operating system of your device. It could make your
              phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
              compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
              that the Ghost Zone app won’t work properly or at all.

                You should be aware that there are certain things that
                Harindulk will not take responsibility for. Certain
                functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
                by your mobile network provider, but Harindulk
                cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                have any of your data allowance left.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                Along the same lines, Harindulk cannot always take
                responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                Harindulk cannot accept responsibility.
              </p>
              <p>
                With respect to Harindulk’s responsibility for your
                use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                to you. Harindulk accepts no liability for any
                loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                currently available on Android – the requirements for
                system(and for any additional systems we
                decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                using the app. Harindulk does not promise that it
                will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                and/or works with the Android version that you have
                installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                from your device.
